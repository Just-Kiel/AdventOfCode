# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## [2015](https://github.com/Just-Kiel/AdventOfCode/tree/2015)
As a test for Rust, I decided to solve few puzzles from 2015 using Rust.

## [2022](https://github.com/Just-Kiel/AdventOfCode/tree/2022)
2022 is my first year participating in the Advent of Code challenges. I am using Python to solve the puzzles.

## [2023](https://github.com/Just-Kiel/AdventOfCode/tree/2023)
I did participate in the 2023 challenges, but I did not finish all of them. I used Python to solve the puzzles.

## [2024](https://github.com/Just-Kiel/AdventOfCode/tree/2024)
I am using Rust to solve the 2024 puzzles.
